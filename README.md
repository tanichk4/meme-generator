# Meme Generator

A simple React-based meme generator that allows users to create and save custom memes. This project is currently **under development**.

## Features

- **Fetch Random Memes**: Fetches random meme templates from the [Imgflip API](https://api.imgflip.com/).
- **Custom Captions**: Add your own captions to the memes.
- **Save Memes**: Save your favorite memes to a list.
- **Duplicate Check**: Prevents saving duplicate memes.

## How It Works

1. Enter a caption for your meme.
2. Click "Submit" to fetch a random meme template.
3. Save your meme by clicking "Save".
4. View your saved memes (feature in progress).

## Under Development

This project is still a work in progress. Planned features include:

- Displaying saved memes in a list.
- Improved duplicate handling and user feedback.
- Option to delete or share saved memes.
- Persisting saved memes using `localStorage`.
